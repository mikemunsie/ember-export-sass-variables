### Note: This project is no longer maintained!
I suggest checking out https://github.com/minusfive/ember-cli-sass-variables-export if you need a great alternative.

Export your SASS variables and access them through a utility. This addon supports any lists / maps / nested maps and uses the built in node-sass functions to parse values.

## Methods

`export (utilName: String, contents: any)`

The export method is used in your SASS file to tell the compiler what name the utility file is, and what variables to export inside.

## Usage
Two parts: Define a sass export and import the utility that matches the name of the export.

```css
$export: export('colors', (
  colors: $colors,
  themes: $themes
));
```

```js
import styles from 'ember-export-sass-variables/utils/colors';
```

## Installation
`ember install ember-export-sass-variables`
